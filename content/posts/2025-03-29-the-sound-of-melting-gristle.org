#+TITLE: the sound of melting gristle

Mull, a new band for me release the sound of melting gristle in January, and since then I've not stopped listening to it, its like an addiction. It does exactly what is says on the tin. I suppose you could call it old school goregrind, like the days of CBT. This meme says it all.

When I saw that rotten roll rex had merch for mull and this album, I instantly put an order in.
