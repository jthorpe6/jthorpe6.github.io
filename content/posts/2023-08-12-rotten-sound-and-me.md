Sod it, its my blog, I'll write about what I want.

Its also letting me trial out `ox-hugo` and spoiler, I love it. But anyway, Rotten Sound... One of my favorite bands of all time, and nearly (by 1 year) as old as me. I got into Rotten Sound when I was 15 with the [Cycles](https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Rotten_Sound/Cycles/178859) album. The cover alone got the young me very intrigued.

Still to this day, some 15 years later, this is still very much a goto album of mine. I was used to listening to Death Metal, with bands like Cannibal Corpse, Nile, and Carcass. But this was something new, and I suppose I could say this is the album that introduced me to Grind Core, It would still take a few more years into my mid 20's before I would give other Grind bands a proper go. But this band stuck around in my play lists. I even saw them live a few times.

Spot the author time, can you see at this gig?

Over the years, I've seen Rotten Sound countless times, and I always enjoy their show, I've never not enjoyed it. Its always been spot on.

So there we have it, truly one of my favorite bands, and defiantly opened up the world of Grind Core for me.
