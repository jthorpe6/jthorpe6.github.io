#+TITLE: Mincecore with Haggus

I first heard of Haggus in 2022 when a friend showed them to me and from there I've been hooked on mincecore ever since, specifically the project Haggus. Earlier this year I made it to Obscene Extreme 24, and Haggus played.

My favourite album of theirs is Straight From The Slaughterhaus, that's not to say their other material is not good (because it is), I just really like this album.

This album for me has made me include more mincecore bands into my music sessions, and if anything I'm starting to *prefer* mincecore, fastcore, and power violence over traditional death metal and grindcore.
