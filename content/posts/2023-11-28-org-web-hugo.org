I love writing in =org-mode= It's much better than traditional =markdown=, however most markdown editors have the ability to render your text so you can preview it before. I argue that a good theme in Emacs allows for this, but none the less, I started looking into a way to render a folder with a bunch of =org-mode= files in it.

* Hugo
This blog's content is written in =org-mode= and then using [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][ox-hugo]] converted to =markdown=. I then noticed that it was rendering the =.org= files with [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]]. This got me thinking that I could just have a simple =docker= container serving the directory of =org-mode= files, and that's exactly what I did.

* Dockerising Hugo
It was actually rather easy to dockerise Hugo, the only /tricky/ part was setting the address to serve on, as by default its =127.0.0.1= but I had to change that to =0.0.0.0=. The entire =Dockerfile= is 13 lines.

#+begin_src dockerfile
  FROM alpine:latest
  RUN apk update && \
    apk add --no-cache \
    hugo \
    git
  RUN hugo new site org-web-hugo
  WORKDIR /org-web-hugo/
  RUN git init && \
    git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke && \
    echo "theme = 'ananke'" >> hugo.toml
  EXPOSE 1313
  ENTRYPOINT ["hugo", "serve", "--bind", "0.0.0.0"]
#+end_src

* Result
Running the container is easy enough too and works really well.

#+begin_src shell :results output
  docker run \
	   --rm \
	   -d \
	   -p 1313:1313 \
	   -v /path/to/folder/of/.org/files:/org-web-hugo/content/posts \
	   org-web-hugo
#+end_src

I made a repo for this small project [[https://github.com/jthorpe6/org-web-hugo][here]].
