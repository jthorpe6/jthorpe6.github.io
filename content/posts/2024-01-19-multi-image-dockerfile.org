#+TITLE: Multi Image Dockerfile

Recently I found out that you can have multiple images in a =Dockerfile=. I found this really helpful for fuzzing, where I could build the harness in one docker image, and then copy only the harness to the AFL++ image. Here is a bit of a bare bone extract of my =Dockerfile=.

#+begin_src dockerfile
  FROM --platform=linux/aarch64 debian AS builder
  # rest of the builder stuff

  FROM --platform=linux/aarch64 aflplusplus/aflplusplus:latest

  COPY --from=builder /build/harness /src/
  COPY --from=builder /build/other_stuff_for_fuzzing /src/
#+end_src

This is useful, when we only care about the last stage.
